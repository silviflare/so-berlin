You start the game with 3 lives and no points. If you collect items throughout the city you will increase your points (some items have more points than others). There are two items that take lives, the E-Scooter and the poops. Try to avoid these two objects if you don't want to lose the game and try to make as many points as possible.

As time goes by the objects come faster and faster which makes the game more difficult.
